Needed libraries:
* Eigen, https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen, C++, header-only
* NLopt, https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, C++, also includes .dll and .dll.a file that have to be linked (I just put the .dll file with the code in one folder and linked the libnlopt.dll.a file)
Instructions:
* I run the code with (/Ox) for speed optimisation in visual studio. (The files needed for the matlab test get generated by the main.cpp file as well.)
* To run the compare test in matlab you need to first run the c++ code and ensure compare.m is in the same folder as the compiled c++ code (or you move the generated text files to the folder containg compare.m).
* other interesting things which can be done
Can we use and modify your code for demonstrations concerning the course? Yes
